# C-PageRank-ScaledFootrule-SearchEngine

This is a small project done in C that recreates how a search engine's page rank algorithm works. On the side, I implemented an efficient way
to combine two rankings into one using the Scaled Foot Rule formula which is inspired by the hungarian algorithm. More can be found here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank
